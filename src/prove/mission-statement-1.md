time: 60 minutes

<!-- START STEP -->
<h2>Review the mockup</h2>
<p>
			Begin by reviewing the image below to see what we are attempting
			to create. Try and look for relationships and groupings in the
			layout that we might need to represent in the HTML.
		</p>
<div class="fig-block">
			<figure>
				<img
					src="/assets/images/mission-statement-mockup.png"
					alt="mockup of mission statement"
				/>
				<figcaption>The goal.</figcaption>

				</figure>
		</div>
<p>
			Create a new folder to hold this project called
			<kbd>mission</kbd>. Then create an html file:
			<kbd>index.html</kbd> and a css file: <kbd>styles.css</kbd>. Add
			the HTML you need to have a valid new page as well as a
			<kbd>link</kbd> element for your CSS.
		</p>

		<!-- END STEP -->
</li>
<li>
<!-- START STEP -->
<h2>Write the HTML</h2>
<p>
			Next add the HTML to display the content. To save you a bit of
			time typing the unformatted text has been provided below
		</p>
<div class="callout">
			<p>
				Brigham Young University-Idaho was founded and is supported and
				guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its
				mission is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders
				in their homes, the Church, and their communities.
			</p>
			<p>The university does this by:</p>
			<p>
				Building testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and
				fostering its principles in a wholesome academic, cultural, and
				social environment. Providing a high-quality education that
				prepares students of diverse interests and abilities for
				lifelong learning and employment. Serving as many students as
				possible within resource constraints. Delivering education that
				is affordable for students and the Church.
			</p>
		</div>
<p>Below you will also find an image for the logo to use.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/byui-logo_blue.webp" alt="BYUI logo, blue" />
<p>
			You should Right-click->Save image as... and save the image file
			into the <kbd>mission</kbd> directory.
		</p>
<p>
			Make sure to refer back to the mockup image above often as you
			write your HTML. In particular here are some details to keep in
			mind:
		</p>
<ul>
			<li>
				Try to use semantic elements as much as possible. For example
				the top section with the title and subtitle is the
				<kbd>header</kbd> of the document. The section with the text
				would be the <kbd>main</kbd> portion of the content, and the
				logo at the bottom acts as a sort of <kbd>footer</kbd>
			</li>
		</ul>
<p>
			<strong>After</strong> you have written your HTML compare it to the example below.
			Your HTML does <strong>not</strong> have to match this potential solution. There is
			more than one way to solve this problem. You should however note
			the differences and think about why.
		</p>
<p>
			<strong>Please</strong> do not copy/paste the HTML below into your document. Your
			goal in this course is hopefully to learn HTML. Copy/pasting the
			solution below will <strong>not</strong> help you with this goal. If you see that
			you need to make changes to your HTML based on what you see below,
			fix your code, don't copy/paste.

<p>
				You may be wondering about the
				<code>&lt;div class="content"&gt;</code> element that I placed
				everything in. This is a fairly common practice, but not always
				necessary. In this case it was used so that some margin could be
				added around the outside of the bordered box to move it away
				from the top of the browser window. See below:
			</p>
<img
				src="/assets/images/mission-statement-content-box.png"
				alt="example of a content box"
			/>

		<h2>Style the document.</h2>
<p>
			In the <kbd>styles.css</kbd> file begin writing the CSS to make
			your page match the mockup. Again here are a few details to keep
			in mind:
		</p>
<ul>
			<li>The font size has been set to 20px for the default.</li>
			<li>The font used is the default: Times New Roman</li>
			<li>The color for the subtitle is #006EB6</li>
			<li>
				Note that while the titles and the main block of content are
				centered, the paragraphs are left aligned
			</li>
			<li>
				The content inside the box has been limited to a maximum width
				of 600px.
			</li>
			<li>
				Remember that <code>margin</code> adds space between elements,
				while <code>padding</code> adds space inside of an element. You
				will need to use both to match the design.
			</li>
			<li>
				To get the titles to look just right you will need to use the
				<a
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing"
					>letter-spacing</a
				>
				property to space the letters out a bit more than they would
				normally be. You can also use
				<a
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform"
					>text-transform</a
				>
				to make sure they are always all caps.
			</li>
			<li>
				To get yours to match the image you will also need to increase
				the
				<a
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height"
					>line-height</a
				>. (A value of 1.5 is usually nice)
			</li>
			<li>
				The image for the logo is larger than we need. You will need to
				make it smaller. We can use CSS to do this for now. Later we
				will learn how to actually change the image file. You can use
				150px for the size.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- END STEP -->
</li>

<!-- START STEP -->
<h2>Commit and push to Github</h2>
<p>
			Commit your changes, then push them to GitHub. Wait a few minutes
			then check to make sure they show on Github pages. If you need a
			review on how to do this check out
			<a
				href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/hosting-git-gihub/ponder2/"
				>github instructions</a
			>. Start around step 3.
		</p>
<p>
			After verifying that your page updated, submit the URL to your
			page in Ilearn. The URL will look something like this:
			<kbd>https://githubusername.github.io/wdd130/mission</kbd>. Make
			sure to replace "githubusername" with <strong>your</strong> actual github username
