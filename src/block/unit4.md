## Prepare

Using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Bard](https://bard.google.com), or [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx) explore the following concepts:

- HTML Forms: "How are forms used to gather information from users on the web?", "What problems should I watch for when creating HTML forms?", "How can I style HTML forms with CSS?"
- Javascript Objects: "What is the purpose for objects in Javascript?", "How do I create an object?", "How can I access the properties of an object?"
- ES Modules: "What are ES modules?" "How can ES modules be used to organize code in Javascript?"

For each topic you have been given sample question(s) to get you started. Watch for terms that you are unfamiliar with in the explanation and ask follow up questions. Your goal with this exercise should be to learn about the topics. When you are done you should have a good understanding of what the topic is, significant vocabulary associated with it, and how it is applied in web pages. Ask *at least* 5 follow up questions on each topic. I would expect that you spend *at least* 15-20 minutes per topic.

Ask the AI to summarize your conversation in a Q/A format to turn in.
