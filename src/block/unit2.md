## Prepare

Using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Bard](https://bard.google.com), or [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx) explore the following topics:

- Responsive Web Design: "What is responsive web design?", "How are css media queries used in responsive design?"
- Debugging Javascript: "What are techniques for debugging Javascript code?", "How can I use breakpoints in the browser?"
- Branching in Javascript: "How can I write Javascript code that makes decisions?", "What are valid conditions?"
- Events with javascript: "How can I respond to events from the browser with javascript?"

For each topic you have been given sample question(s) to get you started. Watch for terms that you are unfamiliar with in the explanation and ask follow up questions. Your goal with this exercise should be to learn about the topics. When you are done you should have a good understanding of what the topic is, significant vocabulary associated with it, and how it is applied in web pages. Ask *at least* 5 follow up questions on each topic. I would expect that you spend *at least* 15-20 minutes per topic.

Ask the AI to summarize your conversation in a Q/A format to turn in.

Questions that might be helpful could be:

- What problems can arise when...?
- Can you give me a specific example? (or another example)
- Are there any other ways to do this?
- Can you give me more information on...?
