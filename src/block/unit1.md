## Prepare

### Review as needed

- [HTML Introduction](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/html/html-intro/)
- [CSS Introduction](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/css/css-intro/)

### Explore

Using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Bard](https://bard.google.com), or [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx) explore the following concepts:

- Javascript basics: "What is Javascript?"
- Javascript variables : "Can you explain how to declare and use variables in javascript?", "What is the difference between let and const?", "Why do variables need to be declared?"
- Manipulating documents (DOM) with javascript: "How can I manipulate an html document with javascript?"

For each topic you have been given sample question(s) to get you started. Watch for terms that you are unfamiliar with in the explanation and ask follow up questions. Your goal with this exercise should be to learn about the topics. When you are done you should have a good understanding of what the topic is, significant vocabulary associated with it, and how it is applied in web pages. Ask *at least* 5 follow up questions on each topic. I would expect that you spend *at least* 15-20 minutes per topic.

Ask the AI to summarize your conversation in a Q/A format to turn in.

Questions that might be helpful could be:

- What problems can arise when...?
- Can you give me a specific example? (or another example)
- Are there any other ways to do this?
- Can you give me more information on...?

We will use the first topic: Javascript basics as an example to illustrate. Here are some questions I used in a conversation with AI to explore the topic:

- What is Javascript?
- Tell me about it's history.
- What is the difference between javascript and ecmascript? (Ecmascript was mentioned in the last response)
- How can I use Javascript in a webpage?
- Tell me more about async and defer (async and defer were mentioned in the last response)
- Can you give me a specific example?
- What are common problems that can occur when using Javascript?
