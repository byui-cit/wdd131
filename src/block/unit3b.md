## Prepare

Using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Bard](https://bard.google.com), or [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx) explore the following concepts:

- Web Accessibility: "What is Web Accessibility?", "how can I make accessible web pages?" "How can I find out how accessible a website is?", "How are these applied for the web?"
- Design Principles : "What are the principles of graphic design?" or "can you give an example of a design process for a website?"
- Javascript Array methods: "Why are there array methods in Javascript?
- Functions in Javascript: "What is the purpose of functions in javascript?", "How can I write functions in Javascript?"

For each topic you have been given a sample question to get you started. Watch for terms that you are unfamiliar with in the explanation and ask follow up questions. Ask *at least* 5 follow up questions on each topic. In Ilearn you will be asked to submit the questions you asked and a summary of what you learned.   Questions that might be helpful would be:

- What problems can arise when...?
- Can you give me a specific example? (or another example)
- Are there any other ways to do this?
- Can you give me more information on...?
