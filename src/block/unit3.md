## Prepare

Using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Bard](https://bard.google.com), or [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx) explore the following topics:

- Web Accessibility: "What is Web Accessibility?", "How can I make accessible web pages?" "How can I find out how accessible a website is?", "How are these applied for the web?"
- Design Principles : "What are the principles of graphic design?" or "Can you give an example of a design process for a website?"
- Javascript Array methods: "Why are there array methods in Javascript?", "What are some examples of using array methods?"
- Functions in Javascript: "What is the purpose of functions in javascript?", "How can I write functions in Javascript?"

For each topic you have been given sample question(s) to get you started. Watch for terms that you are unfamiliar with in the explanation and ask follow up questions. Your goal with this exercise should be to learn about the topics. When you are done you should have a good understanding of what the topic is, significant vocabulary associated with it, and how it is applied in web pages. Ask *at least* 5 follow up questions on each topic. I would expect that you spend *at least* 15-20 minutes per topic.

Ask the AI to summarize your conversation in a Q/A format to turn in.
