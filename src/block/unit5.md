## Prepare

Using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Bard](https://bard.google.com), or [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx) explore the following topics:

- Flexbox: What is CSS Flexbox?, How can I use Flexbox to style web pages?, What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox? When should I use Flexbox over Grid?
- Lighthouse: What is the Chrome Lighthouse tool?, How can it be used to optimize webpages?
- Search Engine Optimization: What is Search Engine Optimization? How can I apply it to a webpage?
- Javascript sorting and filtering: How can I sort an array with Javascript?, How can I filter an array in Javascript?, How can I sort an array of objects in Javascipt?, How can I filter an array of objects in Javascipt?

For each topic you have been given sample question(s) to get you started. Watch for terms that you are unfamiliar with in the explanation and ask follow up questions. Your goal with this exercise should be to learn about the topics. When you are done you should have a good understanding of what the topic is, significant vocabulary associated with it, and how it is applied in web pages. Ask *at least* 5 follow up questions on each topic. I would expect that you spend *at least* 15-20 minutes per topic.

Ask the AI to summarize your conversation in a Q/A format to turn in.
