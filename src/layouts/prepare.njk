      <p>Please explore the following topics with one or more AI assistants. Here is a list of some options if you don't have
        a preference:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://bard.google.com">Bard</a>

      <p class="callout">For each topic you have been given sample question(s) to get you started. Watch for terms that you
        are unfamiliar with in the explanation and ask follow up questions. Your goal with this exercise should be to learn
        about the topics. When you are done you should have a good understanding of what the topic is, significant vocabulary
        associated with it, and how it is applied in web pages. Ask
        <em>at least</em>
        5 follow up questions on each topic. I would expect that you spend
        <em>at least</em>
        15-20 minutes per topic.</p>
      <p>Ask the AI to summarize your conversation in a Q/A format to turn in.</p>
